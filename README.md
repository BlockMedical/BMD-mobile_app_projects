# BMD Mobile App Projects
The BMD crowdsourced machine learning algorithms can also be applied to the mobile data generated through future voice activated app platform along with camera, video data upon app interaction by patient. True artificial intelligence through applying deep learning natural language processing and computer vision techniques to mobile audio[22] and video[23][24] data streams along with machine generated sensor data and be compared to human labelled clinical data in clinical studies.

## Apple iOS Swift and Trust Wallet
We initially selected the [Trust Wallet](https://github.com/BlockMedical/BMD-dapp-wallet-ios) which is one of the official Ethereum wallet to embed the features for BlockMed dApp to upload and access data with the ease of purchase BMD Utility Token with Ethereum and use BMD to access data and code. While the funcitonality is still minimal to what it can access to iOS and an Apple device, we are not done yet. Our future plan is to expand the functionality to include multi-media datasets such as Voice and Audio, Musics, Videos, etc. which can enrich the datasets for Machine Learning and AI. 

## Android with Firefox and Metamask
We currently do not have a native app to run on Android, however, for Android users, you will be able to use [Firefox on Android](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/) along with [Metamask Android extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/ether-metamask/) to access BlockMed dApp to upload and access data with BMD Utility tokens. For better UX, your contribution is welcome to enhance the Android users experience with native Android app, and you may refer to our [iOS Swift and Trust Wallet](https://github.com/BlockMedical/BMD-dapp-wallet-ios) app as reference.
