# BMD Mobile App Projects
The BMD crowdsourced machine learning algorithms can also be applied to the mobile data generated through future voice activated app platform along with camera, video data upon app interaction by patient. True artificial intelligence through applying deep learning natural language processing and computer vision techniques to mobile audio[22] and video[23][24] data streams along with machine generated sensor data and be compared to human labelled clinical data in clinical studies.
